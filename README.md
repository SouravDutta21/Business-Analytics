# Effect-of-Family-on-Work-related-Exhaustion
The authors of the paper “Does Work From Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment” tried to analyse the effects of working from home by conducting a nine-month long Work From Home (abbreviated as WFH hereon) experiment for the call centre employees of airfare and hotel booking departments the at the Shanghai office of the Chinese travel agency, Ctrip. 
In this study, we are trying to analyse what effect having a family might have in the exhaustion levels of an employee using the same dataset used during the experiment. For the study, we do some data exploration from the given dataset used in the actual experiment and try to find some visual relationship between exhaustion and having a family, and how it changes for the people working from home (the treatment group in the actual experiment) and people working from office (the control group in the actual experiment). We then run the different hypothesis tests for the same to see if the effects we have seen visually are significant. We also see if the effects are different for the treatment and control group and whether the difference, if present, is significant enough.
